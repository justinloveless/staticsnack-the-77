  "content": "# Mastering CSS Grid\n\nCSS Grid has revolutionized how we create layouts on the web. It's powerful, flexible, and surprisingly easy to learn.\n\n## What is CSS Grid?\n\nCSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex layouts with rows and columns. Unlike Flexbox, which is primarily one-dimensional, Grid excels at creating intricate page layouts.\n\n## Basic Concepts\n\n### Grid Container\nThe parent element that defines the grid. Use `display: grid` to create one.\n\n### Grid Items\nThe direct children of the grid container. These are automatically placed in the grid.\n\n### Grid Lines\nThe dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid.\n\n## Practical Examples\n\n### Simple Grid Layout\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  gap: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n### Responsive Grid\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));\n  gap: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n- Grid areas for semantic layouts\n- Subgrid for nested grids\n- Grid template areas for complex designs\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCSS Grid is an essential tool for modern web developers. With practice, you'll be creating beautiful, responsive layouts in no time!",
